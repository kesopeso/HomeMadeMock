# HomeMadeMock
Simple mock object for testing in C#.

## Features
Enables calls to mock Setup and Returns methods. So far only simple method handling is implemented.

## Motivation
I was always interested in how Moq framework "knows" when certain methods are called after being set up
and how the return values are set and so on. In this project I tried implementing really basic interface
mocking with method calling functionalities.
